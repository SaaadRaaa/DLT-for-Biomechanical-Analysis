# DLT-for-Biomechanical-Analysis
Usage of direct linear transformation (camera calibration and point reconstruction) for accurate motion analysis in biomechanical applications.

This repository contains the implementation of the Direct Linear Transform (DLT) algorithm for camera calibration, enabling accurate measurement and analysis of motion in biomechanics research. The DLT method provides a robust and efficient solution for calibrating multiple cameras, allowing accurate reconstruction of object points from image points.

## Features
- Camera calibration using DLT algorithm
- Point reconstruction in 2D and 3D space
- Error analysis and validation

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/SaaadRaaa/DLT-for-Biomechanical-Analysis.git`
2. Follow the instructions in the documentation to calibrate your cameras and perform point reconstruction.
3. Customize the code as needed for your specific application.

## Documentation
Please refer to the [documentation](docs/README.md) for detailed instructions on using the DLT algorithm for camera calibration in biomechanical analysis.

# DLT-for-Biomechanical-Analysis
Usage of direct linear transformation (camera calibration and point reconstruction) for accurate motion analysis in biomechanical applications.

This repository contains the implementation of the Direct Linear Transform (DLT) algorithm for camera calibration, enabling accurate measurement and analysis of motion in biomechanics research. The DLT method provides a robust and efficient solution for calibrating multiple cameras, allowing accurate reconstruction of object points from image points.

## Features
- Camera calibration for multiple cameras using DLT algorithm
- 2D and 3D point reconstruction from recorded videos
- Marker detection in images and videos for calibration and tracking
- Error analysis and validation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaaadRaaa/DLT-for-Biomechanical-Analysis.git
